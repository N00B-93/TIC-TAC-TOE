## Introduction

This Python-based Tic Tac Toe game is a console application that enables users to play against the computer. It follows the traditional Tic Tac Toe rules, where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Users are 'X' and the computer is 'O'.
- Players take turns placing their respective marks in an empty cell of the grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all the cells are filled without any player achieving a winning row, the game ends in a tie.
